# TRS-80 BASIC Star Identification Game

## Description
This program is a fun and educational star identification game written in BASIC for the TRS-80. The game displays random star patterns on the screen and challenges the player to identify various constellations by entering the correct letter. Each round of the game presents a different constellation, with a selection of three to choose from.

## How to Play
1. Run the program on a TRS-80 computer.
2. Observe the star pattern displayed on the screen.
3. Below the star pattern, the game will prompt you with a question like "THIS IS A=URSA MINOR B=PERSEUS C=URSA MAJOR".
4. Press the key (A, B, or C) corresponding to your choice of the constellation you think is displayed.
5. If you guess correctly, the game will compliment you and move to the next round. If not, it will encourage you to try again.
6. The game progresses through various rounds, each featuring different constellations.

If you don't have access to a TRS-80 computer and BASIC, you can play a Javascript-emulated version online:
